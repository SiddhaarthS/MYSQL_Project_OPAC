Description
===========
This is an OPAC which has all the expected features. The file db.sql contains only the
table creation. To understand the actual sql code for operations performed or to 
understand how its integrated with the front end, look inside the folder
marked Userinterface. It contains all the java files used to create user interface, 
connectivity using jdbc and also you can find the MySql commands on browsing
through source code
